This is the code repository for [Practical Discrete Mathematics](https://www.packtpub.com/product/practical-discrete-mathematics/9781838983147), published by Packt.

**Discover math principles that fuel algorithms for computer science and machine learning with Python**

## What is this book about?
Discrete mathematics deals with studying countable, distinct elements, and its principles are widely used in building algorithms for computer science and data science. The knowledge of discrete math concepts can help you understand algorithms, binary, and general mathematics that sit at the core of data-driven tasks.
Practical Discrete Mathematics with Python is a comprehensive introduction for those who are new to the mathematics of countable objects. This book will help you get up to speed with using discrete math principles to take your computer science skills to a more advanced level.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the terminology and methods in discrete math and their usage in algorithms and data problems
* Use Boolean algebra in formal logic and elementary control structures
* Implement combinatorics to measure computational complexity and manage memory allocation
* Use random variables, calculate descriptive statistics, and find average-case computational complexity
* Solve graph problems involved in routing, pathfinding, and graph searches, such as depth-first search
* Perform ML tasks such as data visualization, regression, and dimensionality reduction
